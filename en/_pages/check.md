## Description and legend

The check above is very simple: the page is trying to load the icon images (favicon) of the respective sites. The result of the check is marked in the form of a border color around the icon of the corresponding resource.

âšª Gray border â€” **status unknown**, in theory this color should almost immediately change to one of the colors below (but anything can happen). If the color remains gray for a long time, reload the page.

ðŸŸ¢ In an ideal situation, the border color of all the icons should be green, which means that **sites are accessible from your browser** (in any case, the icons of the corresponding sites have loaded).

ðŸ”´ The red border, and the icon image didn't load, is a sure sign that **the site is unavailable**.  
The reasons may be as follows (from simple to complex):
* some plug-in in the browser is to blame (anonymizers, ad blockers, etc.), or some kind of protection built into the browser â€” try to disable all this and check again;
* overdone the antivirus / firewall on your device â€” turn it off completely for a while and check again;
* blocking at the level of your Internet provider (different resources can be blocked in different countries) â€” only a VPN will help here.
