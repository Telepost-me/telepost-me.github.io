You made a post with reactions / buttons, but there is no "Comment" button below the post. Why?

In order for [native Telegram comments](https://telegram.org/blog/filters-anonymous-admins-comments/ru#kommentarii-v-kanalah) to appear under the posts in the channel, you need:

1. **Create a chat (public / private) and connect it to your channel:** Channel Info ‚Üí Edit ‚Üí Discussion (specify the previously created chat).
2. **Remove all reactions / buttons under the post:** native Telegram comments will not appear as long as there are reactions or link-buttons under the post. This is not a Telepost problem, this is how Telegram works ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

As a workaround, you can do a multi-publication with two posts at once:

* the first post contains the main gist and contains buttons / reactions
* second post without buttons / reactions (you can add text / picture), due to which there will be native comments under it

For example, like this (the arrows show the second post ‚Äî there is a text at the top, a picture under it, there are comments at the bottom):
