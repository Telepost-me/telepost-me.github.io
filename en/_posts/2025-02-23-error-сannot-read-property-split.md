In some cases, when [connecting your personal bot to Telepost](2019-04-26-personal-bot-for-telepost.md) an error may appear:

```text
Failed to get information about the bot. Check the token and try again.

Cannot read property 'split' of undefined
```

## Solution

If generating a new token in [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) does not help, try deleting your personal bot in [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) and creating it again.
