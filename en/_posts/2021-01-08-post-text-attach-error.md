Sometimes you may see an error "Check the entered data" when attaching a file to a text post:

This usually happens in the following cases â€” if the attached file:
* size 5 MB or more
* picture is more than 5000 pixels in width or height (empirically established)

**Solution**

The file size needs to be reduced to 5 MB or less. If this is a picture, reduce the size of the picture so that they do not exceed 5000 pixels in width and height.
