# How to add channel/chat to Telepost?

> Important: your can't create posts through [{{ telepost.bot.name }}]({{ telepost.bot.url }}) (service bot), because purpose of this bot is to post publications from Web UI. Your need to create your own bot and add it to Administrators — [see here](personal-bot-for-telepost.mdx) how to do it.

## Add bot as Administrator

Click on channel's name, go to "Channel Settings", then open "Administrators" and add here your personal bot:

To connect chat (group) — do the same in Group Settings.

## Connect channel/chat to Telepost

The channel and chat can be public (can be found in the general search) or private (cannot be found in the general search, can only be joined via an invite link).

### Public channel/chat

If your have public channel, forward to bot any message from channel. Also in case of public channel/group your can send their username to bot.

### Private channel/chat

If you have a closed channel or group, you need to send the bot the channel or group ID, respectively. You can find out the ID in several ways.

1. With these bots:
   * [@getmyid_bot](https://t.me/getmyid_bot) – forward any message from private channel/chat
   * [@myidbot](https://t.me/myidbot) – use command `/getid`

   ⚠️ Most likely, you will need to add `100` to the received id.  
   For example, if the id of your private channel is `1234567890` (the number of digits in your case may be different), then you need to send the following id to the Telepost bot: `1001234567890`.

1. Via the Web UI of Telegram:
   * Log in to [web.telegram.org](https://web.telegram.org/)
   * Find the desired channel/chat and enter it
   * In the browser, in the field with the URL, you will see something like `https://web.telegram.org/a/#-1001234567890` - copy the entire set of numbers that come after the minus sign, in this example you should get `1001234567890` - this is the id

1. If all the previous options did not help, there is a workaround:
   * temporarily make the channel public
   * add the channel to Telepost by forwarding any post from the public channel to the bot
   * make the channel private again

## Activate bot

Send to your personal bot message `/start`:

If everyting was done right, then bot prompts you to create a post.
