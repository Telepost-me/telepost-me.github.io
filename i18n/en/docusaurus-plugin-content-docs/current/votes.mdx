# Voting for ideas/bugs

On this page you will find is a description of the process on how you can vote for any idea/suggestion or bug. Perhaps these votes will influence the choice of what the Telepost service developer will pay attention to first (but this is not certain).

## Decription

Below is a list of ideas and bugs, sorted by votes (works based on reactions in issues on Github): reactions 👎 and 😕 are subtracted from the total number of reactions (counted as negative - votes against). **Only issues that have at least one reaction are displayed** (the number of all votes is greater than 0)!

<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD033 -->
If the list below is empty, or the required issue is not in this list, then you can see the list of issues sorted by reactions directly on GitHub (press <kbd>Sort</kbd>, the drop-down list will contain "Most reactions", and select the reaction to sort). Example for the reaction "👍":

* [Ideas]({{ github.issues.ideas.url }}+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc)
* [Bugs]({{ github.issues.bugs.url }}+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc)

## How to vote

In order to vote for this or that idea / bug (this will help to better understand what is more important to users), you need to:

1. go to [Github to issues page]({{ github.issues.url }}+is%3Aopen)
1. log in to GitHub under your account (create it if you don't have)
1. open the required issue and put the appropriate reaction under the description of the issue

import GithubIssuesReactions from '@site/src/components/GithubIssuesReactions';
