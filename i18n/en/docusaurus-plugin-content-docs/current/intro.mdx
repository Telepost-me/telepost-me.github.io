# Intro

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD041 -->
> Telepost helps channels administrators cut down on routine work and focus on producing quality content. It has deferred posts, a visual editor, collaboration, and more. And most importantly, completely **free**!

<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD033 -->
<iframe
    className="status-page"
    src="https://telepost.instatus.com/embed-status/light-sm"
    width="250"
    height="41"
    frameBorder="0"

The mini-portal was created to help users of the service [{{ telepost.site.name }}]({{ telepost.site.url }}). For all questions, it is better to contact the [Support chat in Telegram]({{ telepost.supportChat.url }}). The service has:

* [Web UI]({{ telepost.webApp.url }})
* [Telegram bot]({{ telepost.bot.url }}) (but it's better to use [you own bot](start/personal-bot-for-telepost.mdx))

## Troubleshooting

If you do not see pictures in the Web UI of Telepost, or, conversely, pictures are not loaded into the post through the Web UI - [check on a special page](check.mdx) for any blocked important resources.

For other problems while working with the Web UI, first try:

* clear site cache / open site in incognito mode
* clear cookies
* open the site in another browser / mobile

Sometimes errors may occur while writing/editing a post through the Web UI. In this case, try to start writing a post from scratch (recreating a post).

## Use FAQ, Luke!

Did the tips above help you? Don't despair and read the FAQ ‚Äî for sure there is already an answer for your question. For your convenience, there is [search](/search) (use the search field at the top right or the key shorcuts <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> / <kbd>CMD</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd>) through all pages and posts on this site. Also, all content is labeled with tags.

Didn't find the answer? Then feel free to go to [{{ telepost.supportChat.name }}]({{ telepost.supportChat.url }}) and ask your question there.

<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line -->
Want to add instructions? You can also notify about it in [{{ telepost.supportChat.name }}]({{ telepost.supportChat.url }}), or add a post yourself ‚Äî create Pull Request to [this repository]({{ github.projectUrl }}).

<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD026 -->
## I found a bug!

First check the list of known bugs (see [list below](#known-bugs) or [on Github]({{ github.issues.bugs.url }})). Didn't find anything similar? Then feel free to [add founded bug]({{ github.issues.bugs.urlTemplate }}) yourself, or write to [{{ telepost.supportChat.name }}]({{ telepost.supportChat.url }}).

## I have an idea / suggestion

<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line -->
Perhaps you were ahead of you and similar idea has already been added to the [ideas list]({{ github.issues.ideas.url }}) (you can [look below](#ideas)). No? Then you can go [here]({{ github.issues.ideas.urlTemplate }}).

## I want to vote for an idea / bug

How this can be done is described on [a separate page](votes.mdx) (spoiler: put a positive reaction on GitHub).
