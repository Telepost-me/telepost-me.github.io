# Why does the uploaded photo rotated?

Sometimes, when uploading photos to Telepost (in a post with the "Text" or "Photo" type), the photo is turned upside down. This is due to the fact that the photo file contains meta-information in [EXIF format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exif) â€” its contains what kind of camera rotation was at the time of shooting.

In order for the meta information not to affect the rotation of the photo, it is necessary to delete the EXIF data. You can use, for example, this programs (there is a huge list on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_digital_image_metadata_editors)):
