# Error `CHAT_RESTRICTED`

Sometimes when trying to publish a post to a chat, a `CHAT_RESTRICTED` error may appear:

The [Telegram Documentation](https://core.telegram.org/method/messages.sendMessage) gives the following description:
> You can't send messages in this chat, you were restricted.

In such cases, you should check:

* is the chat blocked by Telegram itself
* chat bot rights

If everything is in order, then you can try switching connected bots in the web interface: switch to the system bot [{{ telepost.bot.name }}]({{ telepost.bot.url }}), and then return back to a custom bot (or vice versa if you have a system bot by default).

It is recommended to use your own custom bot, how to connect it â€” read in [this instruction](../start/personal-bot-for-telepost.mdx).
