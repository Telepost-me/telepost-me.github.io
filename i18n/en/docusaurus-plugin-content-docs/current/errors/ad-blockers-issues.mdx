# Pictures are not loaded in the Web UI / link-buttons disappear

In case something does not load in the Web UI of Telepost, first of all check the plugins in your browser: issue usually happens due to ad blockers (AdBlock, uBlock Origin, Ghostery, ...).

For example, the text of a link-button may disappear:

Or previews of uploaded images are not loaded:

## Solution

Click the button in your plugin, which is usually called <kbd>Trust this site</kbd>, or just disable the blocking plugin for a while.
