# Why are changes in Telepost not applied to the channel?

If you change a post in the Web UI of Telepost, and these changes are not applied (the post does not change either in the Web UI of Telepost after saving or in the channel in Telegram), and there are no errors, then most likely the reason is that you previously changed the post manually directly in the channel in Telegram.

**This cannot be done, after manually changing a post in the channel, control over the post via Telepost is lost.**

## Solution

There are only two options:

1. continue editing the post manually directly in the channel in Telegram (if you need to edit the buttons - this will be difficult to do, see #2)
1. delete the current post and make a copy of it for replacement already via Telepost, as usual.
