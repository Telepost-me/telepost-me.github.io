# Anonymity: how to show / hide the bot name in posts?

The bot name can be seen:

* in the channel and (in the connected with this channel) chat ‚Äî this means you have configured the "Caption"
* chat only ‚Äî you will need to reconfigure your bot

Let's consider both options.

## Channel

Avatar from the channel, but the name of the bot is visible. It looks something like this (in desktop clients ‚Äî at the top right, in mobile clients ‚Äî at the bottom):

* in the channel:

* in the chat (differs in the source label - "channel"):

The caption is visible in the channel and chat if the message caption setting was enabled:

If you need to remove this caption in the chat, you must turn it off in the channel settings: Channel ‚Üí Information ‚Üí Caption messages (turn it off). After that, the caption will disappear both in the channel and in the connected chat (you cannot turn it off only in one place ‚Äî this is how Telegram works ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è).

## Chat

Often, a Telepost personal bot is configured to publish posts directly in the chat ([instructions for the initial setup](../start/getting-started.mdx)).

In this case, the avatar and the name of the bot itself are visible ‚Äî it looks like a regular message from the user in the chat:

Adding permissions to the bot ["Anonymity" in the chat settings](https://telegram.org/blog/filters-anonymous-admins-comments/ru?ln=a#anonimnie-administratori-v-gruppah) in fact does not give the expected result ‚Äî publications from the bot are not made anonymous and are not hidden with the icon and the name of the chat (it looks like this is how Telegram works ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è):

We can only advise you to change the avatar and the visible name of the bot to those used in your chat. To do this in the bot [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) use [commands](https://core.telegram.org/bots#botfather-commands) `/setname` and `/setuserpic` or inline-buttons <kbd>Edit bot</kbd> ‚Üí <kbd>Edit Name</kbd> and <kbd>Edit Botpic</kbd> set a name and picture ‚Äî both the same as in your chat. Then it will visually look like if the publications are sent on behalf of the chat.
