# Round video

In Telegram, you can send [video messages](https://telegram.org/blog/video-messages-and-telescope), which look like round videos and are short in time (in the common people, rounds).

There are two ways to create a post through Telepost with a round video:

1. via a bot (system [{{ telepost.bot.name }}]({{ telepost.bot.url }}) or [you own bot](../start/personal-bot-for-telepost.mdx))

   To do this, just start creating post in the bot and send your round video to the bot:

2. via [Web UI]({{ telepost.webApp.url }})

   Create a post with type "Video" and upload your round video to it:

   In fact, this way you can publish a video that was not originally round (see the switch under the video), but it is important to meet all the requirements:
   * Video must be square (same width and height)
   * Video resolution should not exceed 640 x 640 px
   * Video length must not exceed 60 seconds
   * The video must have sound (otherwise Telegram will make animation from video)
   * File size should not exceed 8 MB
