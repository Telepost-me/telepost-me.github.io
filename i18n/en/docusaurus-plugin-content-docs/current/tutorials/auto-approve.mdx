# Automatic accept of invites requests for channels

Telegram has the ability to make [invite links for channels/chats with confirmation option](https://telegram.org/blog/shared-media-scrolling-calendar-join-requests-and-more#join-requests-for-groups-and-channels) - the subscriber's entry into the channel / chat on such an invite in the usual case will occur only after confirmation by the admin. Sometimes you may need to make that confirmation approved automatically.

In Telepost, it is possible to make it so that when a new subscriber comes through such an invitation link to the channel, his request to join is automatically processed - confirmation will occur instantly!

To do this, you need to activate this option in the Telepost settings in the [Web UI]({{ telepost.webApp.url }}): "Settings" → "Приём заявок".
