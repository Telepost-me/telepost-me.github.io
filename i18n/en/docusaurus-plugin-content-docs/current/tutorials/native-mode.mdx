# Native mode (bot)

If you get error like this when creating/formatting a post through a bot:

```text
Character '(' is reserved and must be escaped with the preceding '\'
```

so the bot is configured to format posts in [Markdown mode](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#markdownv2-style).

Also, the bot can be configured to format in [HTML mode](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#html-style) — attempts to use native formatting will simply not give any result (for example, it is not possible to make text **bold**, or make [link in text]({{ telepost.webApp.url }})).

In order to use native text formatting **only in the current post** in the bot, select <kbd>Native</kbd> right after adding the post content:

In order to **always** use the native formatting of the post text in the bot, like formatting a regular message, you need to switch the bot to Native mode: <kbd>Settings</kbd> → <kbd>Formatting</kbd> → select <kbd>Native</kbd>:
