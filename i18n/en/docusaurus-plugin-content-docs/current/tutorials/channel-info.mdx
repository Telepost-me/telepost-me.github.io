# Update channel / chat information in Telepost

Sometimes you need to update your channel / chat information:

* avatar
* title
* description

This can be done in two ways:

1. any Telegram client (will be updated in the web version in about 2 hours)
2. the web version of Telepost (menu on the left → Telegram settings):

   After making the changes, do not forget to click the button <kbd>Update</kbd> (the changes will be applied both in the web version and in the channel/chat itself in Telegram — immediately).
